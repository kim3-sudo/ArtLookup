If you'd like to access the dummy version of the website for the pretty pictures (remember, it's a dummy, so nothing actually works) AND you're on the Kenyon network, you can try to access it at [bulbasaur.sejinkim.net:8000](http://bulbasaur.sejinkim.net:8000). This site is not guaranteed to be reliable, and you should not expect it to be up 100% of the time.
